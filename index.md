# Dan's Notes

Hello!  You have stumbled upon Dan's Notes.  For the past 15 years, I've been a somewhat obsessive note-taker.  Any time I work on a new project or with new technology or stumble across something interesting, I like to job down notes.  I blame my bad memory for this habit.  I work with way too many technologies that all have way too many details and idiosyncracies to keep everything in my head.  For that reason, I write down the things that I'll likely forget which have the potential to be useful later. Also, I find that writing things down and organizing my thoughts helps me remember more.

Mainly, I keep notes in my company's wiki tool, but I steel so many notes and how-to guides from the internet, that I feel bad not putting my own lessons learned out there.  I also wonder what would happen if I ever left this company.  How many hundreds of pages of technical notes and how-to guides would I be leaving behind?  Anyway, this is my attempt to publish those notes in a way that not only guarantees better preservation of them over time, but also makes them useful to others beside myself.  Enjoy!
