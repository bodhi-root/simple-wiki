# About Me

At the time of this writing I'm a 38 year old manager of a data science team.  I'm married and a father of two twin boys and a soon-to-be teenage girl.

My career started in software development.  I've been programming most of my life, and it's a good way to earn a living.  My first job out of college was working at the University of Cincinnati in a molecular research lab.  Now, I know next to nothing about molecular research, but the team needed someone to run their Windows and Linux servers, manage their databases, and develop a website that could run their molecular science programs on a distributed hardware infrastructure.  I have to say: that was one of the best jobs to get out of college.  I was responsible for everything: system administration, database design, software development, project management, everything.

When our research funding ran out I had to get a real job.  I found my way to a large company as a software developer and have jumped around the company doing various things for the past decade or so.  I love math and have always enjoyed applying programming to math-related tasks.  Combined with some graduate coursework in business analytics this soon landed me in the data science part of the company. I enjoy what I do, and I remember well the advice of my father: "find a job you love doing and you'll never have to really work."  You can tell that advice stuck because here I am on my day off building a wiki/website.
