# Computer Technology

I've been into computer programming ever since I was a kid.  Back when I was about 10 my dad bought me a book on QBASIC programming.  After that came C.  Then HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  Then in college: Java, C#, Visual Basic, .NET, SQL, Linux shell scripting, and more.  Throughout my career I have taken extensive notes on all kinds of languages, libraries, frameworks, and other topics.  The details of all these are more than I could ever fit in my head.  Let's see if I can make some of these notes public and help others besides myself.  I expect this section of the website to grow rather large, so I have organized it into the sub-sections below.

| [Databases](databases.md) | Systems for storing, indexing, and retrieving information |
